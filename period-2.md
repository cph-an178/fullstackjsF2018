# Period-2  
### Node.js Express and Testing with JavaScript   

*In this period you will be introduced to Express, a minimal and flexible node.js package, that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. We will also introduce the Mocha test framework together with a number of supplementing packages for assertions, mocking etc. Finally you will be introduced to a new kind of databases - NoSQL Databases, with mongoDB as the document database we are going to use  *

[Watch this key-note speech](http://expressjs.com/)

**Exercises:**
* [middleware,server side rendering,sessions and REST](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Bu_FC___DM9tS8fugsLe4EnwjPs4OSYCe6PMsCVE2Y/edit?usp=sharing)

## 08-03-Thuersday
* JavaScript Testing
* JavaScript Backend Testing using Mocha
* Testing asynchronous code
* Mocking with JavaScript

### Before this lesson you should:

### Read/Watch
If you like videos, since it gives you a chance to code along in your own speed, Lynda.com have a complete Node/Express course with some cool testing videos. 
Once logged in to Lynda search for "Node.js Essential Training" and watch:
* Testing with mocha and Chai
*	Asynchronous mocha testing
*	Mocking a server with NOCK
*	Code Coverage with Istanbul

As usual, the API descriptions should be your main resource for Mocha/Chai-questions.
*	[Mocha] (http://mochajs.org/ )
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/#method_throw)


**Exercises:** [JavaScript Backend Testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JyQ4Qgdori9QYZ8Pfjp5x7P5vIGImx0Byc4pNrG9DXA/edit?usp=sharing)

## 14-3 Wednesday
An introduction to NoSQL, MongoDB and Mongoose

#### Before this lesson you should:
I don't plan to talk about NoSQL in general, since Martin Fowler does it a lot better than me. Watch the video given below, either before or afther the lesson. It covers all "general questions" related to NoSQL

Usually I always recommend a local database for development. Since we only have limited time for this topic however, I suggest you create a free account on mlab.com as outlined below, and use this account for all exercises related to MongoDB and Mongoose.
- Create an Account on mlab.com
- Log in
- Create new database
- Just choose amazon or Google or .. and SANDBOX
- Select Europe
- Give it a name
- Click on the database and select Users
- Add database user (otherwise we can’t connect)
- Then copy the standard URI (mongodb// …)
- Use this URL in your Code Examples

### Read/Watch
- [Introduction to NoSQL - Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I)
- [What is Mongoose](https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-mongoosejs-in-node-js-and-mongodb-applications) (one of the exercises for today)

### Exercises
 [What is Mongoose](https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-mongoosejs-in-node-js-and-mongodb-applications)
 
 *This is part of a larger tutorial, related to Express. Complete this tutorial (you also have a great deal of next week) to get a complete Express example including a database*
 
 [Express Tutorial Part 3: Using a Database (with Mongoose)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose#Mongoose_primer)
